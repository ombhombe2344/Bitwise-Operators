# Bitwise Operators
## Aim
To study and implement C++ Bitwise operators.

## Apparatus
VS Code

## Theory
Bitwise operators in C++ operate on the binary representation of integers. They include the bitwise AND (&), which returns a bit set to 1 if both corresponding bits of the operands are 1; the bitwise OR (|), which returns a bit set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1; the bitwise XOR (^), which returns a bit set to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits is 1; the bitwise NOT (~), which inverts all bits of the operand; the left shift (<<), which shifts bits to the left and fills with zeros; and the right shift (>>), which shifts bits to the right. These operators are used for low-level programming tasks, such as setting, clearing, and toggling specific bits, and for performing fast arithmetic operations. Understanding bitwise operators is essential for tasks that require direct manipulation of data at the bit level, such as system programming, graphics, and encryption.
